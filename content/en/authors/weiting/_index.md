Wei-Ting HUNG is a graduate student at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies, where he is pursuing a Master's degree. His research focuses on the regulation of the telecommunication industry in Japan, with a particular emphasis on zero-rating and network neutrality regulation in the Japanese telecommunication market.

Prior to his graduate studies, Wei-Ting earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and information engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. His current research examines the implications of the Japanese government's 2019 initiative to establish a working group on network neutrality and the subsequent guidelines for regulating practices such as zero-rating.

With a keen interest in the intersection of technology, law, policy, and philosophy, Wei-Ting brings a multidisciplinary perspective to his work. His research contributes to the ongoing global discourse on network neutrality regulations, drawing comparisons with similar frameworks in the EU and the U.S.
